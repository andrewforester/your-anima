description: Coordinate work on Your Anima as the orchestrator session — turn the human's requests into GitHub Issues, launch one cloud session per Issue, follow their PRs by events, verify and merge, and report results with web/APK links. Use when the user makes you the orchestrator/coordinator/PM, hands you a screen or feature to "get done", or asks to launch, watch, merge or report on work sessions.

# Orchestrate

You plan, launch, watch and merge. You do **not** write feature code. You may edit only `docs/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/**`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**`, `.github/pull_request_template.md` (via your own PRs), and a design package on its design branch before merging it. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/COORDINATION.md` first, especially **Design source of truth** and **Process lives in Issues**.

## State lives in GitHub Issues
- One task = one Issue = one session = one branch `claude/<short>` = one PR with `Closes #N`.
- Labels (see `docs/COORDINATION.md`): type `screen|theme|infra|docs|design`; status `status: ready` → `status: in progress` → closed by the PR; `status: blocked`, `needs: human`. Swap the status label as it changes.
- Everything about the process is an Issue comment: launch (session id), scope changes, answers to questions, decisions, your verification result with the web screenshot. Never keep task tables or status in the repo.

## Before writing Issues: settle the scope
Ask the human, in one message, what is **out of scope** when the request doesn't say so (e.g. "the header and the nav bar visible in the screenshot: include or not?"). A running session doesn't reliably see later Issue edits, so scope must be final before launch. If it does change later, comment on the Issue **and** check the result for it before merging.

## Turn a request into Issues
Small bugs and polish items: follow `.claude/skills/quick-fix` instead of the steps below.

1. Split into tasks with non-overlapping zones (the ownership table in `COORDINATION.md`). Hot spots (theme, build files, `App.kt`, `.github/workflows/**`) are separate tasks with one owner. At most 3 sessions in parallel.
2. Design first. A screen (or a new part of a screen) needs `docs/design/<name>/` (`SPEC.md`, `screenshot.png`, `assets/`) in `main` before its developer starts.
   - From a **screenshot**: sessions never see the chat, so put the image in the repo yourself. Create `claude/design-<name>` from `main`, commit it as `docs/design/<name>/screenshot.png`, push, then create a `design` Issue (template `design.yml`) that embeds it by raw URL, and launch the session on that branch.
   - From **Figma**: the account is on Starter, **20 Figma MCP calls per month**. Only you call Figma: one `get_design_context` (+ `get_variable_defs` if needed) per frame. Download the assets right away (URLs expire in 7 days), write the package yourself, and merge it.
   - Figma is the style reference; a screenshot only sets content (see `COORDINATION.md`). Check that a screenshot-based package restyles blocks in the Figma language.
3. Review the design PR: scope matches the Issue, questions are in the Issue. For each open question pick a default and write it into `SPEC.md` → **Decisions** (you may edit the package on its branch), and post the list in the Issue. Then merge.
4. Write each implementation Issue from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`: what to build, design package path, zone (may change / must not change), **out of scope**, dependencies, done-when. It must be self-contained: the session never sees your conversation.
5. Theme and screen can run in parallel only if the theme Issue fixes the API contract (exact token names) and the screen Issue says to merge the theme branch as soon as it exists.

## Launch a session
`create_session` with `source_url` = repo, `outcome_branch` = `claude/<short>` (and `source_revision` = that branch if you pre-created it), `permission_mode: auto`, tags `your-anima`, `issue-N`, a `model` by task size (below), and a prompt like:

```
You are a working session on Your Anima. No human is watching; work until the PR is open.
Task: GitHub Issue #N in andrewforester/your-anima. Branch: claude/<short>.
Use the `develop` skill (or `design` for a design Issue). Read the Issue and all its comments via the GitHub MCP tools.
Start with `git fetch origin && git merge origin/main`.
Don't call Figma MCP. Don't merge the PR; the orchestrator does.
Never wait for an answer: post questions in the Issue, take the conservative option, continue.
After the PR is open and green, stop: don't schedule check-ins (send_later); the orchestrator follows the PR.
```

Then set `status: in progress` and comment on the Issue with the session id.

**Model:** `claude-sonnet-5` for theme tokens, small fixes, docs and mechanical tasks; the default (Opus) for design packages and screens. The model is not the main cost driver: long exploration and repeated heavy checks are. Keep Issues precise (likely cause, exact files, how much verification is enough).


**Screenshots from the human** (bug reports from a device): push them to the `screens` branch (`issue-<N>/…` or `bugs/…`) and embed them in the Issue; the session never sees the chat.

## Queue with dependencies (intake → dispatch)
The human sends tasks one after another. File each one as soon as it arrives; don't wait for the batch.

- **Dependencies are explicit.** Every Issue body has a `Depends on` line: `Depends on: #12, #15` (must be merged first) and optionally `Starts on branch of: #14` (a soft dependency: may start as soon as #14's branch exists, because #14's Issue fixes the API contract; the session merges that branch, per the theme/screen rule above). `Depends on: none` when free. Two tasks touching the same file are always a hard dependency. A screen always depends on its design Issue.
- **Status on filing:** any open hard dependency (or a soft one without a branch yet) → `status: blocked` with a comment "Waiting for #12, #15"; otherwise `status: ready`.
- **Dispatch** is one step you run at every wake-up (a new task from the human, a merge, a session's expected finish, a failed session):
  1. For each `status: blocked` Issue: if every hard dependency is closed (merged) and every soft one has a branch, swap to `status: ready` and comment "Unblocked by #N".
  2. Count running sessions (`status: in progress`). While fewer than 3 are running and `rate_limit_info` allows, launch the `status: ready` Issues, oldest first (Launch a session, above).
  3. Nothing launchable: do nothing, write nothing.
- **Merge first, then dispatch**, in the same wake-up: a merge is what unblocks the next Issues, so the queue moves without the human.
- A dependency closed as not planned doesn't unblock: set `needs: human` on the dependent and ask.

## Follow by events, not polling
- **No recurring check-ins.** Every wake-up re-reads your whole context and burns the usage limit.
- You get notified when a child session's turn fails. A clean finish does **not** notify you. So set a one-off `send_later` for when it should be done: design ≈ 15 min, theme ≈ 10 min, screen part ≈ 20–25 min. As soon as its PR exists, call `subscribe_pr_activity` on it.
- You **cannot message a cloud session directly**. Steer it with an Issue comment, which it reads when it checks. If it's idle and needs more, launch a follow-up session on the same branch with a precise prompt.
- Check the rate limit (`get_session` → `rate_limit_info`) before launching a batch. If you're near the limit, launch fewer sessions.

## Verify and merge (the human has allowed autonomous merging)
Merge a PR yourself when all of these hold:
1. CI on the PR is green and the diff stays inside the Issue's zone (and outside its out-of-scope list). Code quality per `CLAUDE.md` → Architecture & code quality: no oversized files, no duplicated components, and an up-to-date `agents.md` in every code package the PR touches.
2. There is a UI test, and for UI changes the session posted a web screenshot in the Issue.
3. CI on the PR is green, including **Web smoke**. Look at 1–2 of its screenshots (artifact `web-smoke-screenshots`) or the session's screenshots in the Issue. Don't build locally. Build locally only when two ready PRs touch the same files and must be checked together; otherwise merge them one after another and let CI re-run on the second.
4. Post the result in the Issue: what you checked and your screenshot (branch `screens`, see `COORDINATION.md`).

After merging:
- **Close out the session right away** (it may have scheduled its own check-ins): read its usage with `get_session`, then archive it. From `external_metadata`: `usage.cost_usd`, `usage.input_tokens`, `usage.output_tokens`, `usage.cache_read_tokens`, `usage.cache_write_tokens`, `context_usage.used_tokens` / `context_usage.max_tokens`, and the model (`last_served_model`). Subagents a session starts with the `Agent` tool are included in its numbers; they aren't reported separately.
- Post a closing comment in the Issue: merged PR, verification summary, and a usage line:
  `Claude: <model> · $<cost> · context <used>k / <max>k · tokens in <input+cache_read+cache_write>k (cache read <cache_read>k) / out <output>k`.
- Then run **Dispatch** (Queue with dependencies).
- Wait for CI on `main` (lint, Android, Web, iOS, the two publish jobs). After merging, watch CI on `main`. If it goes red, the top priority is a revert PR or a fix.
- Report the result with these links. Use a `PushNotification` (it may not reach the phone) **and** a chat message:
  - Web: https://andrewforester.github.io/your-anima/
  - APK: https://github.com/andrewforester/your-anima/releases/download/main-latest/your-anima-debug.apk
  - **Cost** table: each Issue's session (model, USD, context used, output tokens), the orchestrator's own spend since the previous report (`get_session` without an id → `usage.cost_usd`; subtract the total you gave last time) and its current context (`context_usage.used_tokens`), and the round total.
  - The queue: Issues still `ready`/`blocked` and what each waits for.
  - What a human still has to check on a device (Android visuals, iOS): there is no emulator in the container.
- A red `main` is the top priority.

## Keep the orchestrator cheap
The orchestrator is usually the most expensive session: every wake-up re-reads the whole conversation. So:
- Wake up only for real events (a session's expected finish, CI on `main`); combine several checks into one wake-up.
- Don't paste large outputs into the conversation (diffs, logs, screenshots): look at `--stat`, grep for errors, view one screenshot.
- Watch your own `context_usage.used_tokens` (`get_session` without an id; it updates after each turn). When the conversation passes ≈300k tokens of context or a round is finished, suggest to the human to continue in a fresh orchestrator session; the state is all in Issues, so nothing is lost.

Ask the human (`needs: human`) about:
- changes to process rules;
- new dependencies or version bumps;
- CI changes;
- deleting anything;
- design decisions that neither Figma nor the screenshot answers and that are costly to change later (cheap ones: pick a default, record it, tell the human in the report).

## Talking to the human
Write only when something is finished (with links), blocked, or needs a decision. No progress chatter.
