name: orchestrate
description: Coordinate work on Your Anima as the orchestrator session — turn the human's requests into tracker tasks, open a branch and draft PR per task, launch one working session on it (the same kind of session as the orchestrator itself), follow the PR, verify and merge, and report results with links. Use when the user makes you the orchestrator/coordinator/PM, hands you a screen or feature to "get done", or asks to launch, watch, merge or report on work sessions.

# Orchestrate

You plan, launch, watch and merge. You do **not** write feature code. You may edit only `docs/**`, the root `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/skills/**`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.github/pull_request_template.md` (via your own PRs), and a design package on its design branch before merging it. Read `AGENTS.md` and `docs/COORDINATION.md` first: **Tracker** (where tasks live, statuses, labels, the brief format) and **Tooling** (the concrete commands for every step below).

## State lives in the tracker
- One task = one ticket = one session = one branch `claude/<short>` = one PR that closes the ticket. **You** open the branch and the draft PR before launching the session; the session only pushes to it and marks it ready.
- Every ticket gets a **Role** and a **Type** label; move its status as it changes (Backlog → Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done). **Needs human** when you wait for the human.
- Everything about the process is a ticket comment: launch (session name/id), scope changes, answers, decisions, your verification result with the screenshot. Sessions may only be able to write PR comments: mirror what matters to the ticket. Never keep task tables or status in the repo.

## Before filing: settle the scope
Ask the human, in one message, what is **out of scope** when the request doesn't say so (e.g. "the header and the nav bar visible in the screenshot: include or not?"). A running session doesn't reliably see later edits, so scope must be final before launch. If it does change later, comment on the ticket and the PR **and** check the result for it before merging.

## Turn a request into tasks
Small bugs and polish items: follow `.claude/skills/quick-fix` instead of the steps below.

1. Split into tasks with non-overlapping zones (Hot spots in `COORDINATION.md`). Hot spots (theme, build files, routing/app shell, API contract, CI config) are separate tasks with one owner. Big features get their own tracker project (epic).
2. **Research / architecture first** when the feature needs a decision (backend, data model, third-party service): a docs-only task (Role Research or Architecture) that fixes the API contract before backend and frontend start. The backend's **first commit** is the shared contract file; the frontend session merges the backend branch to get it instead of copying it.
3. **Design first** for anything visible. A screen (or a new part of a screen) needs `docs/design/<name>/` (`SPEC.md`, `screenshot.png`, `assets/`) in `main` before its developer starts.
   - From a **screenshot**: sessions never see the chat, so put the image in the repo yourself: create `claude/design-<name>` from `main`, commit it as `docs/design/<name>/screenshot.png`, push, then file a Design task that points to it, and launch the session on that branch.
   - From a **design tool** (Figma etc.): only you call it, within the budget in `COORDINATION.md` → Design source of truth. One design-context call per frame. Download the assets right away (their URLs expire), write the package yourself, and merge it.
   - From a **description** only: a package with a mock page over the real tokens and rendered PNGs. Before merging, reconcile it with the API contract (limits, error codes, formatting) and append an **Orchestrator decisions** section to its `SPEC.md` that overrides conflicting items.
   - A screenshot-based package must restyle every block in the reference language (`COORDINATION.md` → Design source of truth).
4. Review the design PR: scope matches the task, questions are in comments. For each open question pick a default, write it into `SPEC.md` → **Decisions** (you may edit the package on its branch), and list them on the ticket. Then merge.
5. Write each implementation ticket in the brief format (`COORDINATION.md` → Tracker): what to build, design package, zone (may change / must not change), **out of scope**, dependencies, done-when. It must be self-contained: the session never sees your conversation.
6. Theme and screen, or backend and frontend, run in parallel only if the task that owns the contract (token names, endpoints and shapes) fixes it in its brief, and the other task says to merge that branch as soon as it exists.

## Launch a session
Launch every task as a **new agent in a new background session**, with the launch command from `COORDINATION.md` → Tooling → Sessions (which kind of session, the exact command and flags, models and limits are all there).

1. Open the branch and the draft PR (Tooling → Code host) and start following the PR right away.
2. Write the prompt: the whole brief (the session may not be able to read the tracker), the branch, the draft PR number, the skill to use, and the standing rules:
   ```
   You are a working session on Your Anima. No human is watching; work until the PR is ready.
   Task: <ticket> (brief below). Branch: claude/<short>. Draft PR: #P (already open; don't open another).
   Use the `<skill>` skill. Report and ask questions as PR comments (and on the ticket if you can).
   Use Anthropic's design / system-design / architecture skills when available, after the project skills.
   Start with `git fetch origin && git merge origin/main`. Commit and push early and often.
   Don't call design-tool MCPs. Don't merge the PR; the orchestrator does.
   Never wait for an answer: post the question, take the conservative option, continue.
   When done, mark PR #P Ready for review (that's the signal), then keep it green. Don't schedule check-ins.
   ```
3. Pick the model by task size (Tooling → Sessions). The model is not the main cost driver: long exploration and repeated heavy checks are. Keep briefs precise (likely cause, exact files, how much verification is enough).
4. Set the ticket to In Progress and comment with the session name and id. Schedule one fallback check-in for when it should be done.

**Screenshots from the human** (bug reports from a device): upload them to the ticket (`COORDINATION.md` → Tracker → Screenshots); the session never sees the chat.

## Queue with dependencies (intake → dispatch)
The human sends tasks one after another. File each one as soon as it arrives; don't wait for the batch.

- **Dependencies are explicit** tracker relations (hard: blocked by; soft: starts on branch of). Two tasks touching the same file are always a hard dependency. A screen always depends on its design task.
- **Status on filing:** an open hard dependency (or a soft one without a branch yet) → Backlog with a comment "Waiting for {{TRACKER_KEY}}-12, {{TRACKER_KEY}}-15"; otherwise Todo.
- **Dispatch** is one step you run at every wake-up (a new task, a merge, a session's expected finish, a failed session):
  1. For each Backlog ticket: if every hard dependency is Done (merged) and every soft one has a branch, move it to Todo and comment "Unblocked by {{TRACKER_KEY}}-N".
  2. Count running sessions (In Progress). While fewer than the limit are running and the usage limit allows, launch the Todo tickets, oldest first.
  3. Nothing launchable: do nothing, write nothing.
- **Merge first, then dispatch**, in the same wake-up: a merge is what unblocks the next tasks, so the queue moves without the human.
- A dependency canceled rather than merged doesn't unblock: set **Needs human** on the dependent and ask.

## Follow by events, not polling
- **No recurring check-ins.** Every wake-up re-reads your whole context and burns the usage limit.
- Follow each task's PR from the moment you open it. The session marking it Ready for review starts CI, and CI's result is your signal to verify. A session that finishes cleanly without marking the PR ready sends no signal, and ready signals can get lost: keep one fallback check-in per running task and, when it fires, look at **all** open PRs. Cancel it when the ready signal arrives.
- Steer a running session through a comment it reads, or a message if your kind of session can reach it. If it's idle and needs more, launch a follow-up session on the same branch with a precise prompt.

## Verify and merge (only if the human has allowed autonomous merging; otherwise ask)
Merge a PR yourself when all of these hold:
1. The diff stays inside the task's zone (and outside its out-of-scope list). Code quality per `AGENTS.md` → Architecture & code quality: no oversized files, no duplicated components, an up-to-date `AGENTS.md` (with its `CLAUDE.md`, root `AGENTS.md` → Package docs) in every code folder the PR touches, about purpose and domain rather than implementation.
2. There is a test, and for UI changes the session posted a web screenshot.
3. CI on the PR is green, including the web smoke job. Look at 1–2 screenshots. Don't build locally, except when two ready PRs touch the same files: then check their merge locally, or merge them one after another and let CI re-run on the second. Backend: follow the deploy check in Tooling.
4. Post the result on the ticket: what you checked, with your screenshot.

After merging:
- **Close out the session right away:** read its usage (model, USD when known, context, tokens), then archive or remove it (Tooling → Sessions).
- Closing comment on the ticket: merged PR, verification summary, and a usage line:
  `Claude: <model> · $<cost> · context <used>k / <max>k · tokens in <input+cache_read+cache_write>k (cache read <cache_read>k) / out <output>k`.
- Then run **Dispatch**.
- Don't watch CI on `main`: the `qa-release` session does and reverts or files a fix when it goes red. Before each merge, check that the latest CI run on `main` isn't red; if it is, merge only the fix or revert.
- Report to the human with links (Tooling → Notifications):
  - the deliverables from `AGENTS.md` → Git & CI;
  - **Cost** table: each task's session (model, USD, context used, output tokens), your own spend since the previous report and your current context, and the round total;
  - the queue: tickets still Todo/Backlog and what each waits for;
  - what a human still has to check on a real device or another browser.
- A red `main` is the top priority: pick up the QA fix task first.

## Hand off
When your context passes ≈250k tokens, the human asks, or a round ends. You can't see an exact counter: estimate from the conversation (tool outputs dominate) and hand off early rather than late. First write a short **process retrospective** (what cost time, what broke, what worked) and turn it into a PR on the process docs (`.claude/skills/**`, `docs/COORDINATION.md`, `docs/SETUP.md`); merge it. Then write a handoff comment in the tracker (the epic's project or main ticket): open tickets and their state, running sessions (name, id, branch, PR), decisions not yet in docs, pending human actions, and cost so far. Then launch a new orchestrator the same way as a task session (`COORDINATION.md` → Tooling → Sessions) with "Use the orchestrate skill. Continue <epic>; the handoff is in <link>.", give the human its id, and stop your watchers and check-ins.

## Keep the orchestrator cheap
The orchestrator is usually the most expensive session: every wake-up re-reads the whole conversation. So:
- Wake up only for real events; combine several checks into one wake-up.
- Don't paste large outputs into the conversation (diffs, logs, screenshots): look at `--stat`, grep for errors, view one screenshot.
- Watch your own context size; past ≈250k tokens or at the end of a round, hand off (above).
- Tracker writes echo the whole ticket back: edit descriptions with `patch`, prefer comments over rewrites, don't re-read what you just wrote.
- Wait with background `until` loops (one condition) or the PR monitor (a stream), never `sleep`; answer routine monitor events in one line.

Ask the human (**Needs human**) about:
- changes to process rules;
- new dependencies or version bumps;
- CI changes;
- deleting anything;
- design or API decisions that neither the reference nor the screenshot answers and that are costly to change later (cheap ones: pick a default, record it, tell the human in the report).

## Talking to the human
Write only when something is finished (with links), blocked, or needs a decision. No progress chatter.
