description: Turn a screenshot (or photo/mock) of an app screen into a Your Anima design package — docs/design/<screen>/SPEC.md with tokens, measurements, structure, texts and behaviour, plus screenshot.png and assets/ — without calling design-tool MCPs. Use when asked to spec, describe, reverse-engineer or prepare the design of a screen from an image, or when a session is started on a task with the Design role.

# Design from a screenshot

Output: `docs/design/<screen>/` in the same shape as the packages already in `docs/design/` (the first one is your reference for format and depth). A developer session will build the screen **only** from this package, so anything you leave out gets guessed.

**Never call design-tool MCPs** (Figma etc.): they are rationed and only the orchestrator uses them. Your zone is `docs/design/<screen>/**` and nothing else.

## 1. Get the image into the repo
- Find the screenshot:
  - usually the orchestrator has already committed it as `docs/design/<screen>/screenshot.png` on your branch (the brief says so);
  - a path the human or the brief gives you;
  - an attachment saved under `~/.claude/uploads/`.

  If you can only *see* it in the chat and have no file, ask the human to attach it as a file or commit it, and stop.
- Save it as `docs/design/<screen>/screenshot.png`, keeping the original resolution.
- Record the pixel size and the scale: CSS px (or dp) = image px ÷ (image width ÷ logical width). Take the logical width from `docs/COORDINATION.md` → Scaffold decisions (target viewport) unless the image says otherwise.

## 2. The reference is the style, the screenshot is the content
The style reference (`docs/COORDINATION.md` → Design source of truth) sets sizes, colours, type, radii and spacing. So:
- Take from the screenshot *what* is there: blocks, order, content, texts, icons, illustrations, behaviour.
- Specify *how it looks* in the reference language: read the theme/tokens code and the existing design packages, then give every block the matching treatment (card fill/border/radius/padding/shadow, type styles, spacing grid, text colours).
- Sample screenshot colours (Python/PIL, flat areas only) to identify the *role* of each colour, then map the role to an existing token. A new token is justified only when the reference has no colour for that role; list it in **"New tokens needed"** with a suggested name. The theme owner adds it in a separate theme task.
- Record notable screenshot-vs-reference differences in one short table, for information only.
- **Stay consistent with screens already built.** Before sizing anything, read the other packages in `docs/design/` and the code of built screens and shared components. The same role gets the same treatment on every screen: page title, section title + subtitle, "View All"-type links, pills, primary/secondary buttons, cards, carousels, navigation. Screenshots often have oversized text and buttons: scale them to the existing type roles and control sizes, don't copy them. Name the reused component/token for each block, and list pieces that should be shared with an existing screen under **"Shared components"** (they get moved to shared components, not copied).

## 3. Measure and describe
Write `SPEC.md` with these sections:
- **Source**: the image, the date, what it shows, and the scale used.
- **Colours**: each colour as a token name, hex value and where it's used. Mark each one as *existing* or *new*.
- **Typography**: each style as its token, size/weight and where it's used. Estimate size from cap height (cap ≈ 0.7 × font size for most sans fonts) and round to whole px.
- **Layout**, top to bottom: every block with size, padding, gap, corner radius, border, shadow and alignment. Round to a 2 px or 4 px grid, and state how sure you are when a value is an estimate ("≈16").
- **Texts**: every visible string, verbatim. These become the screen's strings file.
- **Icons and images**, for each one:
  - which existing icon matches;
  - or a precise description (shape, stroke width, size, colour) for a new vector icon;
  - or, for photos and avatars, a crop saved to `assets/` (PIL crop at full resolution, noting it's a placeholder).
- **States and behaviour**: taps, hover/focus, selection, scrolling, loading/empty/error, and anything implied but not shown.
- **Responsive**: how the layout changes between the target viewports, if the project has more than one.
- **Decisions**: for each question the image doesn't answer, the conservative default you chose. The orchestrator may change them.
- Skip anything the brief lists as **out of scope**, even if it's in the screenshot.
- **Data**: what should come from mocks / the API (names, numbers, lists).

## 4. Check yourself
- Re-read the screenshot block by block against `SPEC.md`: every visible element must appear once.
- Check the sums: the widths of the items in a row plus the gaps and paddings should equal the viewport width.

## 5. Deliver
- Re-read the brief and all comments first: scope may have changed while you worked.
- Commit only `docs/design/<screen>/**`.
- **Comment** (on the PR, and on the ticket if you can) with the open questions (each with the default you put in Decisions), the new tokens, and anything you're unsure of. Never stop to wait for an answer: nobody is watching.
- Push to the draft PR the orchestrator opened (never open another), add a short summary to its body next to the ticket reference, and mark it **Ready for review** as your last step (`docs/COORDINATION.md` → Tooling): that starts CI and signals the orchestrator.
- Don't merge; the orchestrator merges and then files the theme and screen tasks from your package.
