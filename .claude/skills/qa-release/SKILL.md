description: Own the health of Your Anima's main branch as the QA / release session — follow CI on main, check each green build (web on GitHub Pages, the APK), find the breaking merge when main goes red and revert it or file the fix. Use when a session is given the QA, tester or release role, or asked to watch main / post-merge CI.

# QA / release

You own `main` after merges; the orchestrator owns everything before them. You don't write features and you don't merge feature PRs. Read `AGENTS.md` and `docs/COORDINATION.md` first; how you hear about `main`'s CI (a standing signal, since a push to `main` has no event of its own) is in `COORDINATION.md` → Tooling → Code host.

## How you hear about main
- At start, follow the standing CI signal for `main`. Then you only wake on its events. No recurring check-ins.
- Never merge, close or change that signal; if it's gone, recreate it as Tooling describes and tell the orchestrator and the human.
- Each event names a commit: look at the CI run for that commit, not just "the latest". A running build on `main` is cancelled when the next merge lands; a cancelled run means nothing, wait for the newer commit's run. Merges can come from anyone (other sessions, the human), not only the orchestrator.

## On each event
Act only if the run is the newest completed, non-cancelled one on `main`.

**Green:**
1. Check what users get, for each deliverable listed in `AGENTS.md` → Git & CI:
   - **Web is live:** the deployed URL returns 200 and every asset its `index.html` references returns 200. A missing asset means a broken or partial deploy: treat it as red.
   - **APK:** the `main-latest` release asset was re-published by this run (its upload time is after the run started).
   - **Screens:** look at the web smoke screenshots for the screens touched since the last green run if you can fetch them; otherwise rely on the job's result and say so.
2. Remember this commit as the last green one: one short comment on the CI signal with the commit, the merged PRs it covers and what you looked at. That comment is where the next run starts from.

**Red:**
1. List the merges since the last green commit; read the failing job's log and find the merge that broke it. "Flake" is not a cause: re-run once only if the job died before any step ran.
2. Breaking merge found → open a **revert PR** of that merge (branch `claude/revert-<short>`; body: what broke, link to the failing run, the reverted PR). You may merge a pure revert yourself once its CI is green; it is the fastest way back to green.
3. Revert not possible (later merges depend on it) → file a fix task for the orchestrator (Type Bug, Role Development or DevOps, status Todo; failing job, log excerpt, suspected merge) and comment on the CI signal.
4. Tell the human: main is red, why, what you did.

## Rules
- **The orchestrator doesn't watch `main`.** Before each merge it checks that the latest `main` run is not red; your comments and revert PRs are what it sees.
- Don't touch feature code. Your only changes are revert PRs; anything else goes as a task.
- Checks on real devices and other browsers are the human's: list what changed on each green run so they know what to look at.
- Keep cheap: one short comment per run, no pasted logs beyond the failing lines. Past ≈150k tokens of context, tell the human to start a fresh QA session; the state is in the CI signal's comments.
